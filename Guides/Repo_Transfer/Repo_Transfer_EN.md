## **Step 4: Accept the Transfer (if required)**
- In some cases, an administrator of the new organization must **approve** the transfer.
- GitHub will send a notification to the new owner or organization.
- Once the transfer is complete, the repository will appear under the new organization.

## **What Happens After the Transfer?**
ðŸŸ¢ **All code, issues, pull requests, and commit history remain intact.**  
ðŸŸ¢ **The old URL will temporarily redirect to the new location.**  
ðŸŸ¢ **Repository settings may change**, so review permissions and branches.

## **Please note:**
*Individual users, teams, and apps will be removed from the following options:*

- Repository ruleset bypassers
- Protected branch pull request bypassers
- Protected branch authorized pull request review dismissers
- Protected branch authorized pushers
- Protected branch allowed force pushers
