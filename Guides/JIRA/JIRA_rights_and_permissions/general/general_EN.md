### Comprehensive Guide to Rights and Permissions in Jira and Its Products

Jira, Atlassian's popular project management tool, provides a flexible and detailed permissions system that allows administrators to control access to various features across different products (Jira Software, Jira Service Management, Jira Work Management, etc.). Understanding how to manage these permissions is crucial to ensure users have the correct level of access to execute their tasks while protecting the integrity of your data.

### 1. **Jira Permissions Overview**

Permissions in Jira control who can access specific features of Jira, perform certain actions, and modify issues, projects, or configurations. Permissions are typically organized into:

- **Global Permissions**: These apply across the entire Jira instance (e.g., System Administrators, Jira Administrators).
- **Project Permissions**: These apply within a specific project (e.g., Create Issue, Edit Issue).
- **Issue Permissions**: Permissions tied to specific actions within an issue (e.g., Transition Issues, Add Comments).
  
In addition to permissions, Jira uses **Project Roles** and **Groups** for more granular control.

### 2. **Jira Products and Their Specific Permissions**

Each of Jira's products—Jira Software, Jira Service Management, and Jira Work Management—has a set of permissions that are tailored for the needs of the users in that context.

#### **Jira Software Permissions**
These permissions allow users to manage software development projects. Some examples:
- **Create Issues**: Allows users to create issues (e.g., stories, bugs).
- **Manage Sprints**: Allows users to manage sprints in Scrum or Kanban boards.
- **Manage Versions**: Allows users to create, edit, and delete versions/releases.

#### **Jira Service Management Permissions**
These permissions cater to IT support and customer service teams. They include:
- **Customer Permissions**: These define who can view and raise requests in the portal.
- **Manage Queues**: Allows users to set up and manage service desk queues.
- **Respond to Requests**: Permission to reply to customer requests in the queue.

#### **Jira Work Management Permissions**
These permissions are focused on business project management and are similar to Jira Software but simplified for non-technical users. Common permissions include:
- **Create Issues**: Users can create business-related issues (e.g., tasks, to-dos).
- **Transition Issues**: Users can move an issue through the workflow stages.

### 3. **Permission Schemes**

**Permission Schemes** are a collection of permissions associated with a project. These schemes are essential because they define who can do what within the context of a project.

- **Assigning Permissions**: Admins assign users or groups to specific permissions.
- **Types of Permissions in Schemes**: 
    - **Project permissions** (e.g., Create Issues, Assign Issues, View Issues).
    - **Issue permissions** (e.g., Edit Issues, Transition Issues).
  
**Steps to configure permission schemes:**
1. Go to **Jira Administration** > **Issues** > **Permission Schemes**.
2. Select the scheme to edit or create a new one.
3. Add or remove permissions for various roles or users.

---

### 4. **Project Roles**

Project roles allow for assigning users to specific project-related tasks. For instance, a project might have roles like **Project Manager**, **Developer**, and **Tester**. These roles are then associated with specific permissions within the permission scheme.

- **Default Roles**: Jira provides some default roles like:
    - **Administrators**: Can manage project configurations, permissions, etc.
    - **Developers**: Typically can work on issues and participate in development-related actions.
    - **Users**: Can view and comment on issues.
  
- **Custom Roles**: You can create custom roles to fit specific needs in your organization.

---

### 5. **Global Permissions**

Global permissions apply to the entire Jira instance, not just individual projects. These include permissions like:
- **Jira Administrators**: Full access to configure and administer the Jira instance.
- **System Administrators**: Highest level of access, including system-wide settings and access to the database.
- **Browse Users**: Permissions to view user profiles and groups.
  
**Steps to configure global permissions:**
1. Go to **Jira Administration** > **System** > **Global Permissions**.
2. Edit roles and users/groups accordingly.

---

### 6. **Issue Security**

**Issue Security Schemes** are used to restrict who can view and interact with certain issues based on their security level.

- **Security Levels**: Define who can view certain issues based on criteria (e.g., specific roles or groups).
- **Example**: An issue might be marked as "Confidential," and only users in the **Management** role can view it.

**Steps to configure Issue Security:**
1. Go to **Jira Administration** > **Issues** > **Issue Security Schemes**.
2. Create a security scheme and define security levels.
3. Associate the security scheme with specific projects.

---

### 7. **Permission Schemes vs. Workflow Permissions**

**Workflow Permissions** allow control over who can transition issues from one status to another. These permissions are critical for managing the movement of issues within a project lifecycle.

- **Transition Permissions**: Define who can move an issue from one status to another (e.g., from "In Progress" to "Done").
- **Workflow Conditions**: Additional controls that may limit who can perform certain actions in the workflow.

These are tied to the workflows used in a project.

---

### 8. **Customizing Permissions for Advanced Use Cases**

Jira allows for fine-tuning permissions using:
- **Custom Permission Schemes**: If you have multiple teams with different needs, you can create custom permission schemes.
- **Advanced Permissions**: Using custom fields, issue security levels, or workflow transitions can control who can perform specific actions.

---

### 9. **Managing Permissions in Jira Service Management**

For Jira Service Management, permissions control both internal agent access and customer portal access. These are typically managed through:
- **Customer Permissions**: Determine who can create requests in the portal.
- **Queues**: Configure queues and determine who can access and work in those queues.
- **Request Types**: Configure request types to allow different workflows and permissions for different types of requests.

**Example**: You might want to allow only certain users to view certain queues (e.g., only certain agents can work on high-priority incidents).

---

### 10. **Troubleshooting Permissions Issues**

When permissions are misconfigured, it can lead to issues like:
- **Access Denied**: Users cannot access features they need.
- **Over-Privileged Users**: Users have more access than they should.

To troubleshoot:
1. **Check Permission Schemes**: Ensure users are assigned the correct permissions.
2. **Review Roles**: Ensure users are in the correct roles.
3. **Audit Logs**: Use Jira's audit logs to trace changes to permissions and roles.

---

### Conclusion

Jira’s permission management system is comprehensive and flexible, but it requires careful planning and configuration. The key to success is understanding how permissions at different levels (global, project, issue) interact with one another. By structuring your permissions well and regularly reviewing them, you ensure that users have the right access and can efficiently complete their tasks without compromising security or project integrity.
