### ðŸ”¹ **Customers in the JSM project (Project â†’ Customers menu)**

When you're **inside a JSM project**, and you go to the **"Customers"** section in the **project sidebar**, you're looking at:

- **Customers who are part of this specific JSM project.**
- These are **end-users** (not agents/admins) who can raise requests through the portal or email.
- They may or may not have Atlassian accounts (depending on your settings â€” they could be portal-only).
- You can:
  - Add/remove them from the project.
  - Group them into **Organizations** (helpful for sharing requests).
  - See what requests theyâ€™ve raised in this project.
  
**Think of these as the people allowed to use this service desk**.

### ðŸ”¸ **Customers in the "Directory" sidebar (Admin settings â†’ Customers section)**

Now, when you go to **"Directory"** on the sidebar (this appears in **Project settings** or under the **Admin section**, depending on your setup), and then click on **"Customers"**, this is a **broader, site-level view**:

- You're seeing **all customers known to your Atlassian site**, not just tied to a specific JSM project.
- These are users with the **"Customer" role** in general â€” they donâ€™t have product access like Jira Software or Confluence.
- This list includes customers across **multiple JSM projects**.
- You manage:
  - Portal accounts.
  - General invitations to your service portal (not project-specific).
  - Account-level things like email and whether theyâ€™re Atlassian-registered or not.

**Think of this as your global address book of all customer users**.
