### Jira Permissions & Role Alignment

---

#### **Executive Summary**
- We’re implementing a **clean role-based access model** in JSM.
- Aligning **AD groups to Jira project roles**.
- Addressing **permission sprawl** in current scheme.
- Goal: Improve **security**, **clarity**, and **maintainability**.

#### **Current Role-to-Group Mapping**
| **Role**               | **Purpose**                   | **AD Group** | **Status**     |
|------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------|----------------|
| Project Admin          | Full project control          | `ADM`        | ✅ Created      |
| Ticket Support         | Works on tickets              | `SDT`        | ✅ Created      |
| Approver               | Review/approve only           | `APPR`       | ✅ Created      |
| Customer (Portal)      | End-user request access       | `SDC`        | ✅ Created      |
| Project Adapter        | Manages workflows/sprints     | `PAD`        | ❌ To Create    |
| Adapter Viewer         | Read-only for config/data     | `PAV`        | ❌ To Create    |

#### **Current Risks in PIT Permissions**
##### 🚨 Excessive Use of "Any Logged-In User"

Permissions currently assigned to **Application access (Any logged-in user)**:

| Permission                | Risk                              |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| View Development Tools    | Exposes commits/builds to all     |
| Assign Issues             | Anyone can assign tickets         |
| Close Issues              | Anyone could prematurely close    |
| Create/Edit Issues        | Anyone can create/change data     |
| Modify Reporter           | Could manipulate audit trail      |
| Move/Resolve Issues       | Changes issue state at will       |
| Schedule Issues           | Can tamper with timelines         |
| Transition Issues         | Override workflow transitions     |
| Add/Edit/Delete Comments  | Uncontrolled narrative changes    |
| Attachments & Worklogs    | Uploads/deletions without trace   |
| Work On Issues            | Worklogs/logs without ownership   |
| View Voters/Watchers      | Access to user-level metadata     |

> ⚠️ **This creates a security and audit nightmare.**

#### **Recommended Permission Cleanup**
| **Action**                      | **Replace With**       |
|---------------------------------|------------------------|
| “Any logged-in user”            | Role-based AD groups   |
| Unclear scheme                  | New customised scheme  |

---

#### **Updated Role-to-Permission Mapping**
| **Permission**          | **Role**           | **AD Group** |
|-------------------------|--------------------|--------------|
| Browse / View           | Support, Viewer    | `SDT`, `PAV` |
| Create / Edit Issues    | Ticket Support     | `SDT`        |
| Manage Sprints/Workflow| Project Adapter     | `PAD`        |
| Administer Project      | Project Admin      | `ADM`        |
| Add Comments            | Support / Approver | `SDT`, `APPR`|

#### **Implementation Timeline**

**Short-Term Actions**
- [ ] Create **`PAD`** and **`PAV`** AD groups
- [ ] Assign them in **User Management > Groups**
- [ ] Update **permission scheme** to:
  - Remove **“Any logged in user”**
  - Replace with proper **Project Roles**
- [ ] Ensure **each Project Role** maps to an AD group via **Users and Roles**

**Phase 1: Cleanup**
- [ ] Implement new permissions scheme
- [ ] Reassign project roles properly

**Phase 2: Harden & Scale**
- Audit all shared schemes
- Document handover process

#### **Benefits for Patronale Life**
- 🔒 Improved security and visibility
- 🧠 Role clarity for teams
- 🔧 Easier permission management via AD
- 🧱 Foundation for future scaling & governance
